# Platform, Screen Count, and Flow

Read this when choosing a mobile platform mode, screen count, onboarding structure, or believable screen-to-screen navigation.

## 2. PLATFORM MODE RULE

Always decide the platform mode first.

Choose one:
1. iOS-native premium
2. Android-native premium
3. cross-platform premium neutral

### iOS-native premium
Bias toward:
- cleaner top areas
- tab-bar clarity
- safe-area awareness
- elegant spacing
- restrained chrome
- calm hierarchy
- native-feeling sheets and cards
- polished but not overdecorated interfaces

### Android-native premium
Bias toward:
- stronger component rhythm
- clearer app bar behavior
- bottom navigation clarity
- sheet logic
- card/list structure
- slightly firmer layout framing
- more explicit state clarity where useful

### Cross-platform premium neutral
Bias toward:
- clean safe-area handling
- universal mobile navigation patterns
- clear hierarchy
- less platform-specific ornament
- premium but broadly buildable visual language

Do not mix iOS and Android patterns carelessly.
Pick one dominant platform feel and stay coherent.

## 3. MANDATORY SCREEN-FIRST RULE

For mobile app requests, generate the screen image or screen set directly.

Do not:
- answer with only text
- describe what the app could look like without generating it
- collapse multiple screens into one vague idea board if the user actually needs a flow

The main deliverable is:
- one or more mobile screen images
- optionally extra detail views when needed
- a clear flow set when multiple screens are requested

## 4. GENERATE ENOUGH SCREENS RULE

Generate enough screens to make the flow feel real.

Do not be lazy with screen count.

If the user asks for:
- 1 screen → generate 1 screen image
- 2 screens → generate 2 screen images
- 3 screens → generate 3 screen images
- 5 screens → generate 5 screen images
- 7 screens → generate 7 screen images
- onboarding flow → generate multiple onboarding screens, not one
- auth flow → generate separate sign in / sign up / recovery states when useful
- app concept → generate a meaningful set, not one isolated hero mockup

It is better to generate:
- multiple clean readable screens
than:
- one compressed board with tiny unreadable text

If a detail is unclear:
- generate an extra detail image
- or regenerate that screen cleanly

Never reduce screen count just for convenience if it weakens the app concept.

## 5. DO NOT CROP OLD IMAGES RULE

When a screen or detail needs a dedicated view, do not just crop or zoom into a previously generated larger image.

Do not:
- crop a settings view out of a larger board
- crop tiny onboarding copy out of a multi-screen collage
- crop a small card from a broader screen to inspect it
- rely on cutouts if they distort spacing, proportions, or typography

Instead:
- generate a fresh standalone screen image
- generate a fresh detail render
- keep the same design language, colors, type mood, and component family
- make the new image specifically optimized for readability

Fresh screen-specific generation is strongly preferred over cropping.
